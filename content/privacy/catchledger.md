## Information We Collect

CatchLedger is designed to help users track catches and trip stats. We collect only the data needed to provide that functionality.

- **Account or Identifier Information (Optional):**  
  If you choose to create or sign in to an account, we store the identifier needed to keep your entries synced.

- **Catch and Trip Entries (User Provided):**  
  Information you enter (such as fish species, dates, notes, and measurements) is stored so it can be displayed back to you.

- **Approximate Location Data (Optional):**  
  If you choose to save locations for entries, those locations are stored with your records.

## Data Storage and Usage

Your CatchLedger data is used only to provide core app features such as activity logs, summaries, and backups/sync.  
We do not sell personal information.

Information is retained until you delete records or request account deletion.

## Third-Party Services

CatchLedger may rely on third-party services for hosting, authentication, and analytics needed to operate the app. These providers may process limited technical data under their own privacy terms.

## Your Choices

You can choose what information to add, edit, or remove in the app. Optional fields remain optional, and you may use the app without entering non-essential details.

## Changes to This Policy

If CatchLedger privacy practices change, this policy will be updated on this page.
