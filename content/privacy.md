## Information We Collect

Spiral Word Puzzle collects a limited amount of user information solely for leaderboard functionality.

- **Authentication Information (Required):**  
  When submitting a high score, we collect a username or unique identifier to associate scores with players.

- **Country Location (Optional):**  
  You may optionally choose your country from a list when submitting a high score. This is not automatically collected and is only stored if selected by you.

## Data Storage and Usage

All collected information is stored securely in a private SQL database hosted by the app developer.  
No personal information such as email address, real name, phone number, or device location is collected.

The data is used only to display scores on the leaderboard and will never be sold or shared with third parties.

## Third-Party Services

The app uses the following SDKs and dependencies:

- **React Native Firebase (Core only):**  
  Used for app functionality, not analytics or crash reporting.

- **AdMob (react-native-google-mobile-ads):**  
  May collect anonymized device and usage data per [Google's AdMob policies](https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads).  
  Users under 13 receive child-appropriate ads.

- **Other Modules:**  
  SDKs such as AsyncStorage, Expo, Lottie, and country picker are used only for local functionality and do not collect user data.

## Changes to This Policy

If we make changes to our app that affect this policy, we will update this page accordingly.
